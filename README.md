Welcome to Fluid
================

Fluid has been created by <a href="http://www.reactive.com/">Reactive</a> and is a branched version of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs">Foundation</a> a responsive front-end framework. You can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on any kind of device with Fluid, which includes layout constructs (like a fully responsive grid), elements and best practices.

Fluid like Foundation is mobile-first however Fluid extends browser support to include IE8 and graded support for IE7 by providing non mobile-first styles to thoes browsers that dont support media queries.

Partials

We have also included all of the available Foundation modules as middleman 'partials' to further increase the speed of prototyping.

These partials can be found <code>/source/components/</code>.


Snippets
========
Fluid includes snippets to aid with development. These snippets are available in both as gists as well as downloadble and locally insatllable files for the excellent Sublime text editor.

* [Sublime Text2 Bundle](https://github.com/schalmersdev/Sublime-Foundation-Snippets/).
Place the snippets in your Sublime Snippets folder ie. /Packages/User.
You can then access these snippets using the first 3 letters of the item you wish to use pre-pended with the letter 'z'. Example to use a button you should use: zbut <code>tab</code> to activate the button snippet.

* Alternatively you can access individual non-editor specific snippets here: [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/schalmersdev).
