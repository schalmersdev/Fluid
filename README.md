Welcome to Fluid
================

Fluid is based on Foundation a responsive front-end framework. You can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on any kind of device with Fluid, which includes layout constructs (like a fully responsive grid), elements and best practices.

Fluid has extended browser support to include IE8 and graded support for IE7 by providing non mobile-first styles to thoes browsers that dont support media queries. .

Fluid also contains alternative components for rapid devlopment of items such as 'Listings' etc.

We have also created Fluid snippets to further help with development. These snippets are available in both as gists as well as downloadble and locally insatllable files for the excellent Sublime text editor.
